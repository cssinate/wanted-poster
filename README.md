# WORK IN PROGRESS - Wanted Poster Generator
This is a project based on a thread on reddit found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DungeonsAndDragons/comments/e2x7yf/). I figured I could take the same idea and make a web application out of it.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Run your tests
```
npm run test
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
